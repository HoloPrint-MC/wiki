# Creating packs
> [!TIP]
> On Android the Structure Block export button is hidden; please use [this pack](https://holoprint-mc.github.io/exportbutton) to add it back.
1. In a creative world, use a Structure Block to export a `.mcstructure` file. To get a Structure Block, run the command `/give @s structure_block`.

3. Generate and download your resource pack (`.mcpack`).
