# Coordinate lock
HoloPrint allows you to lock your holograms to specific coordinates, meaning that no matter where the armour stand is placed, the hologram will always be at the same position.

Holograms using "Coordinate lock" will always be facing the same direction as they did in the world where they were exported.

## Enabling coordinate lock
On the pack creation screen, enable to _Settings_ > _Advanced_ > _Coordinate Lock_. You will now be able to enter the coordinates for each structure to be locked to.

The _Get global coordinates_ button will find the position your structures were saved at, before they were exported. This is useful if you have a creative copy of your world, because it will guarantee that you build it at the same position in your survival world. Note that this position is not the position of the structure block, but rather the position of the corner of your structure (i.e. where the red, green and blue lines meet).

## Adjusting coordinates
You can adjust coordinates for each structure by typing the coordinates into each text box.

If you're making a multi-structure pack which needs all structures to be aligned with each other, you can adjust the coordinates for all structures at once. Simply select an axis, then press the buttons to change it by a specified amount.

This will ensure that the relative positions of each structure are preserved.
